# Scott Cohen's Mega-Awesome AmEx Reverse-Engineer Code Project

Hello, fine AmEx friends! Welcome to my audition piece. Here is where I'll document the process for this little exercise.

## The Project Setup

Project setup took about a half-hour, mostly thanks to Git troubleshooting with my remote repo. I used NPM to install Next.js, which includes react, react-dom, and all the good stuff that you'll find in the package.json. I added the React testing library and Vitest separately.

## The Coding

Once I got into the coding, I pared things down and kept them relatively basic. I built a very simple &lt;dialog&rt; element with a &lt;button&rt; inside to close the modal. I built out a useEffect() function (which was really the hardest part of the test, because I'm still getting used to React-style routing) that added event listeners for the open modal button, the close button, the ESC key, and clicking outside the modal when it's open. My JS/React can of course be tightened up, but this is what you get in two hours. ;)

## The Testing

Testing is actually the weakest part of my toolkit; my previous employers didn't...actually...require that, which is terrible practice, but I have a basic understanding of it. Perhaps that's what we could go over in person!

## You've been looking at a lot of applicants' work. Here is an ASCII picture of a bunny.

        /    \   '. __.'
       _|    /_  \ \_\_
      {_\______\-'\__\_\

Thanks for considering me for this position!
